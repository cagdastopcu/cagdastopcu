### Hi there, I am Cagdas. I develop neural signal processing methods in MATLAB and Python ðŸ‘‹
### I have 8 papers in biomedical engineering and neuroscience journals, 2 patent applications on cognitive brain modulation with electrical stimulation, more than 15 connference presentations and talks and 2 book chapters.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on human verbal memory.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Pytorch.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about neuroscience, data science and signal processing.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me (twitter): @cagdastopcu
- :star: Papers: [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=KoQ8mMQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao "Google scholar")
